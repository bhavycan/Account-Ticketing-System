# Account-Ticketing-System

## Objectives:

Created an account ticketing application that basically tracks the system for customer-reported problems. When a customer has a problem, they will phone or email for support. The person handling the support request will create a ticket for the request that contains the details of the problem and the customer contact information so that the customer can be notified when there is a solution.

## Result:

## Output using Python Script

You can make your own "Sample input file"  and save it as the name " a2ms2_4-long-inputs.txt" to get the quick output. Althought, if you just want to check the output, I have posted the sample file and script for the python as well.
